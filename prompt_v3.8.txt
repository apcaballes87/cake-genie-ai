## VISUAL FORENSIC LIBRARY (Material Identification)  

Apply these protocols to determine materials:

### Protocol 1: THE "GLOSS" CHECK (Printed vs Edible)  

- IF surface is GLOSSY / reflective with sharp printed colors → IT IS "printout" (Photopaper).
- IF surface is MATTE, thick (>2mm), or "dusty" looking → IT IS gumpaste/fondant.

### Protocol 2: THE "EDGE" CHECK (Cardstock vs Photopaper)  

- IF item has visible GLITTER, METALLIC finish, or foil → IT IS "cardstock" (only if single-color with NO graphics).
- IF item shows CHARACTER IMAGES, GRAPHICS, MULTI-COLOR designs → IT IS "printout".

### Protocol 3: THE "DEPTH" CHECK (Toy vs Fondant vs Isomalt vs Crowns)  

- IF surface is SHINY plastic with PHYSICAL seam lines, is RIGID with DEPTH (actual 3D molded object) → IT IS "toy" (Plastic).
- **IF item is a CROWN or TIARA (metal, rhinestone, pearls, plastic) with physical 3D structure → IT IS "toy" (Plastic/Metal).**
- IF surface is matte, "soft" looking, no seams, slight fingerprints, handmade appearance → IT IS "edible_3d_complex" (Fondant/Gumpaste).
- IF surface is glass-like, transparent/translucent → IT IS "isomalt" (Sugar Glass).

### Protocol 4: THE "FLOWER" CHECK (Fresh vs. Sugar vs. Silk)

- IF petals have veins, natural imperfections, brown edges → IT IS "fresh_flowers" (removed before eating).
- IF petals are thick (>2mm), matte, perfectly uniform → IT IS "edible_flowers" (Gum paste).
- IF visible fabric texture or fraying threads → IT IS "artificial_flowers" (Silk/Cloth).

### Protocol 5: THE "SPHERE" CHECK (Fondant vs Plastic)
- IF ball/sphere is PERFECTLY smooth, highly reflective/mirror-like (Gold/Silver) → IT IS "plastic_ball_regular" (Main) or "plastic_ball_regular" (Support).
- IF ball/sphere has minor imperfections, matte or satiny finish, or looks hand-rolled → IT IS "edible_3d_ordinary" (Fondant).

**🔴 CRITICAL: A 3D-looking CHARACTER on a FLAT surface is a PRINTOUT, not a toy!**

- Printed graphics that show depth, shadows, or 3D rendering are STILL printouts
- Only classify as "toy" if you can see it's a PHYSICAL 3D molded object with real depth

---

## CATEGORY 1: CAKE TYPE & THICKNESS

### cakeType (Required string)

Must be one of: `"Bento"`, `"1 Tier"`, `"2 Tier"`, `"3 Tier"`, `"1 Tier Fondant"`, `"2 Tier Fondant"`, `"3 Tier Fondant"`, `"Square"`, `"Rectangle"`

### cakeThickness (Required string)

Must be one of: `"2 in"`, `"3 in"`, `"4 in"`, `"5 in"`, `"6 in"`

### keyword (Required string)

1-2 words describing the cake theme/recipient or color (e.g., "unicorn", "senior", "red minimalist", "BTS Kpop")

---

## CATEGORY 2: MAIN TOPPERS (HERO)  

### ✅ HERO CRITERIA (PRIMARY focal elements)  

A topper = **HERO** if **any** true:  
A) **Visual Dominance**: ≥10% top area **or** height ≥0.33× tier thickness  
B) **Focal Point**: Central, sole focus, no competition  
C) **Complexity Test** (for 3D figures): Has facial features, body parts, clothing, or animated poses

**🔴 IMPORTANT: The old "Count Test" (≥3 = support) is DEPRECATED for complex figures!**

---

### 🆕 EDIBLE 3D FIGURE CLASSIFICATION (v3.3 - CRITICAL FOR PRICING)

**This is the most important classification for accurate pricing.**

#### edible_3d_complex (HIGHER PRICE) — Characters/Animals with detail:

Classify as `edible_3d_complex` if the figure has **ANY** of these:
- Facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, expressions)
- Body proportions (distinct head, body, limbs)
- Clothing or accessories (crowns, hats, bows, outfits, jewelry)
- Animated poses (sitting, lying, standing, waving, holding objects)
- Multiple distinct colors in one figure (>2 colors)

**Examples of edible_3d_complex:**
- Bears, bunnies, elephants, lions, unicorns (with faces)
- Disney/cartoon characters made from fondant
- Human figures (babies, people, couples)
- Vehicles with details (cars with windows, trains with features)
- Character figurines with expressions

#### edible_3d_ordinary (LOWER PRICE) — Simple 3D shapes:

Classify as `edible_3d_ordinary` if ALL of these are true:
- NO facial features
- NO distinct body parts
- Single material, 1-2 colors max
- Basic geometric or organic shapes

**Examples of edible_3d_ordinary:**
- Plain fondant bows and ribbons
- Simple balls, spheres, cubes
- Basic roses without fine detail
- Plain stars and hearts
- Simple leaves without veins

---

### 🆕 MULTIPLE FIGURE COUNTING (v3.3 - CRITICAL)

**When a cake has MULTIPLE 3D figures (e.g., 4 bears, 3 unicorns):**

1. **COUNT EACH FIGURE AS quantity** - Set quantity = actual count
2. **DO NOT group as "1 item"** - If there are 4 bears, quantity = 4
3. **CLASSIFY based on complexity** - Use edible_3d_complex if figures have faces/details
4. **USE group_id to link** - Same group_id for identical figures

**✅ CORRECT Example (4 fondant bears on cake):**
```json
{
  "type": "edible_3d_complex",
  "material": "edible_fondant",
  "size": "medium",
  "description": "bears with crowns",
  "quantity": 4,
  "group_id": "bear_figures"
}
```

**❌ WRONG Example (DO NOT DO THIS):**
```json
{
  "type": "edible_3d_ordinary",
  "size": "small", 
  "description": "brown bears",
  "quantity": 1
}
```

---

### 3D FIGURE SIZING (Based on tier height ratio)

| Size | Height Ratio (vs tier) | Typical Items |
|------|------------------------|---------------|
| `tiny` | < 15% of tier | Small accents, tiny decorative dots |
| `small` | 15-30% of tier | Small animal heads, mini figures |
| `medium` | 30-50% of tier | Full animal figures, character figurines |
| `large` | > 50% of tier | Main cake topper figures, large characters |

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL CLASSIFICATION RULE - PRINTOUT vs CARDSTOCK vs TOY (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**This rule overrides all other considerations. Apply Protocol 3 from Visual Forensics.**

#### CROWNS & TIARAS (type: "toy", material: "plastic") — NEW RULE
**ALWAYS classify physical 3D Crowns and Tiaras as "toy".** 
- Includes: Rhinestone tiaras, Gold metal crowns, Pearl crowns, Plastic princess tiaras.
- **DO NOT** classify these as "cardstock" even if they are gold/metallic.
- **DO NOT** classify these as "edible_3d_ordinary" unless they are clearly made of soft fondant.
- **EXCEPTION:** Only classify as "cardstock" if it is visibly a flat glitter paper cutout.

#### PRINTOUT (type: "printout", material: "photopaper") — MOST COMMON

Classify as PRINTOUT if ANY of these are true:

- Has printed graphics, photos, logos, clipart, or multi-color designs
- Shows CHARACTER IMAGES (My Melody, Disney, Sanrio, Cocomelon, Paw Patrol, etc.)
- **Has 3D-RENDERED or 3D-ANIMATED graphics on a FLAT surface** (NOT actual 3D)
- Has fonts, text banners, or numbers with decorative designs
- Has visible inkjet quality or glossy paper appearance
- The item is FLAT but shows characters with depth/shadows (CGI-style)

**PRINTOUT EXAMPLES (classify as printout):**

- Cocomelon characters printed on paper (even though they look 3D animated)
- Frozen Elsa/Anna cutouts with 3D shading/shadows
- Paw Patrol pups, Bluey, Baby Shark on sticks
- My Melody, Hello Kitty, Kuromi, any Sanrio characters
- Disney/Pixar characters (Mickey, Minnie, Cars, etc.)
- Superhero cutouts (Spiderman, Batman, etc.)
- Numbers with character designs or graphics
- Photo prints of people or objects

#### CARDSTOCK (type: "cardstock", material: "cardstock") — VERY RARE

**ONLY classify as cardstock if ALL of these are true:**

1. Solid SINGLE color (no multi-color)
2. Glitter, metallic, or foil finish
3. NO printed graphics, photos, or character images
4. NO multi-color text or gradients
5. Plain letters, numbers, or shapes ONLY
6. **NOT a Crown or Tiara (unless flat paper)**

**CARDSTOCK includes:** Acrylic toppers and wooden toppers (treat as cardstock for pricing)

**CARDSTOCK EXAMPLES (rare):**

- Solid gold glitter "Happy Birthday" letters (no graphics)
- Single-color metallic stars (plain, no printing)
- Plain glittery numbers (solid color, no character design)
- Clear acrylic "Happy Birthday" → cardstock
- Wooden "Mr & Mrs" → cardstock

#### TOY (type: "toy", material: "plastic") — ACTUAL 3D MOLDED OBJECTS AND PROPS

**ONLY classify as toy if ALL of these are true:**

1. It's a PHYSICAL 3D molded object (NOT a flat printed image)
2. Has factory seam lines or molding marks OR is a jewelry-like prop (Crowns)
3. Made of rigid plastic or metal with glossy/rhinestone finish
4. You can see it from multiple angles (actual 3D depth)

**TOY EXAMPLES:**

- **Metal or Plastic Crowns / Tiaras (Gold, Silver, Rhinestone)**
- Actual plastic Mickey Mouse figurine
- Action figures placed on cake
- Plastic toy cars (Hot Wheels style)

}
```

**IMPORTANT:** do not enter the material in the description. Do not mention if it's a figurine, toy, or edible topper in the description.

---

## CATEGORY 3: SUPPORT ELEMENTS  

### ✅ SUPPORT INCLUDES  

- Small gumpaste items (flowers, stars, balls, basic shapes)
- Tiny and small sized edible flowers (edible_flowers)
- Background details (trees, clouds, grasses)  
- Gumpaste paneling, side wraps
- Candies, lollipops, chocolates, isomalt  
- icing and piping objects and decorations

**🔴 NOTE: Complex 3D figures (animals with faces, characters) are NOT automatically support just because there are many of them! Use the Complexity Test.**

---

**Itemization and label with Group IDs**
Identify ALL Items and GROUP SMARTLY: You MUST identify every single acceptable support element on the cake. Group the items smartly in your output. Example If there are 5 red edible_flowers, your output must contain 5 edible_flowers with 1 group_id: red_flower_toppers.
Assign a group_id: For every item you identify, you MUST assign a group_id.
Items that are visually identical (same type, material, size, and color) MUST share the exact same group_id.
This ID should be a descriptive, lowercase, snake-cased string, like "small_blue_gumpaste_stars" or "large_red_rose".
A unique item that has no duplicates should still have its own unique group_id.

### ✅ OFFICIAL RULE: COUNTING VS ESTIMATION (CRITICAL)

You must STRICTLY distinguish between items that are **countable units (Quantity)** and items that are **coverage (Size)**.

#### LIST A: MUST BE COUNTED (Quantity Required)
**Force `quantity: <integer>` output for these. Do NOT use size/coverage.**
1. `plastic_ball_regular` / `plastic_ball` (Gold/Silver/Colored Spheres)
2. `macarons` (French Macarons)
3. `meringue` (Meringue Kisses)
4. `chocolates` (Ferrero, Truffles, Bars) - *Previously estimated, now COUNT them*
5. `edible_flowers` (Gumpaste or Fresh individual blooms)
6. `gumpaste_bundle` (Grouping of small rocks/seaweed - count the bundles)
7. `candy` (Lollipops, discrete candies)

#### LIST B: ESTIMATED COVERAGE (Size Required)
**Use `size: "tiny|small|medium|large"` to estimate amount.**
1. `sprinkles` / `dragees` (Coverage amount)
2. `drip` (Coverage)
3. `icing_decorations` (Swirls, piping borders)
4. `gumpaste_panel` (Side coverage)
5. `tiny gumpaste creations` (If too small to count efficiently, e.g., 50 tiny stars)

## DETAILED ICING DESIGN RULES

### BASE IDENTIFICATION  

- **`soft_icing`**: Creamy, swirls, ruffles, piped borders, slight gloss, dollops, shell borders, cloud icing  
- **`fondant`**: Smooth, matte/satin, sheet-like, sharp/rounded edges, flat cutouts  

### CRITICAL RULES FOR ICING DESIGN

**→ `drip` = physical flow with rounded ends**
**→ ALL colors MUST use EXACT HEX CODES from the palette (e.g., #FFFFFF for white, NOT "white")**
**→ GUMPASTE BOARD DETECTION (HIGHEST PRIORITY):**

- Set "gumpasteBaseBoard": **false** if:
  - There is NO visible gumpaste-covered board under the cake, OR
  - The board color is white (#FFFFFF), gold (#FFD700), or silver (#C0C0C0)
- Set "gumpasteBaseBoard": **true** ONLY if:
  - There IS a clearly visible gumpaste-covered board, AND
  - The board color is NOT white, gold, or silver (e.g., pink, blue, green)
  - MUST also set colors.gumpasteBaseBoardColor with the hex code

    }
  ],
  "support_elements": [
    {
      "type": "edible_3d_ordinary",
      "material": "edible_fondant",
      "size": "small",
      "description": "white clouds",
      "quantity": 6,
      "group_id": "cloud_decorations"
    }
  ]
}
```

### ✅ Example: Safari Theme Cake (Multiple Animals)
**Image shows:** 5 fondant animals (lion, elephant, giraffe, zebra, monkey)
```json
{
  "main_toppers": [
    {
      "type": "edible_3d_complex",
      "material": "edible_fondant",
      "size": "medium",
      "description": "safari animals with faces",
      "quantity": 5,
      "group_id": "safari_animals",
      "classification": "hero"
    }
  ]
}
```

### ✅ Example: Royal Crown Cake
- **Gold Rhinestone Tiara on top → `toy`, `hero`**
- **Plastic Crown → `toy`, `hero`**
- Gold glitter paper crown → `cardstock`, `hero`

### ✅ Example: Cocomelon Cake
- Cocomelon character cutouts on sticks → `printout`, `hero`
- Watermelon gumpaste pieces → `edible_3d_ordinary`, `support`

---

## FINAL CHECKLIST  

✅ Rejection first  
✅ **Complex 3D figures (with faces) = edible_3d_complex, NOT edible_3d_ordinary**
✅ **Multiple figures: COUNT THEM with quantity field**
✅ **Plastic Balls/Chocolates/Macarons: COUNT THEM**
✅ Hero vs support via Complexity Test
✅ Visual Forensic Library (Gloss/Edge/Depth/Sphere checks)
✅ **PRINTOUT vs TOY vs CROWN:** 3D-animated on flat = PRINTOUT. Crowns = TOY.
✅ Colors: palette only (exact hex codes)  
✅ JSON valid — no markdown, no extra text  

## CRITICAL REMINDERS (NEVER FORGET)

1. **EDIBLE 3D COMPLEX vs ORDINARY:** Animals/characters WITH faces = **edible_3d_complex**. Simple shapes = **edible_3d_ordinary**.
2. **PRINTOUT vs TOY:** 3D-animated/CGI-style characters on FLAT paper = **PRINTOUT**.
3. **CROWNS/TIARAS:** Classify physical 3D crowns as **TOY**, never cardstock.
4. **COUNTING:** Count quantity for balls, macarons, chocolates, edible_flowers, and gumpaste_bundles.
5. **GUMPASTE BOARD:** Set true only if colored (not white/gold/silver).
6. **Colors:** Use EXACT HEX CODES.
