    content: `Planning to tie the knot in Metro Cebu? Congratulations! Before you start picking out flowers and venues, there's one essential piece of paperwork you need to secure first — your **marriage license**.

The process is largely the same across the Philippines (governed by the Family Code), but each city has its own local civil registrar office, seminars, fees, and small quirks. In this guide, we'll walk you through the step-by-step process for getting your marriage license in **Cebu City, Mandaue City, Lapu-Lapu City, and Talisay City** — so you know exactly what to expect no matter where in Metro Cebu you're filing.

## Before Anything Else: What You Need to Know

Here are the universal rules that apply regardless of which Metro Cebu city you're filing in:

- **Who can apply:** Both parties must be at least 18 years old, male and female, and at least one must be a resident of the city where you're applying.
- **Personal appearance is required.** Both applicants must show up together at the Local Civil Registrar (LCR) office.
- **10-day posting period.** After you submit your documents, there is a mandatory 10 consecutive days of public posting before your license is released. This is required by law to allow any objections.
- **Marriage license validity.** Once issued, your marriage license is valid for **120 days** and can be used **anywhere in the Philippines**.
- **Parental consent/advice rules:**
  - **18–21 years old** — Parental Consent is required (parents must sign before the Civil Registrar)
  - **22–25 years old** — Parental Advice is required (written acknowledgment from parents)
  - **26 and above** — No parental consent/advice needed

## Common Requirements for All Metro Cebu Cities

While each LCR may have slight variations, here is the standard list of documentary requirements you'll need to prepare:

### For Filipino Applicants (Both First-Time)

1. **PSA Birth Certificate** — Must be a recent copy issued by the Philippine Statistics Authority (original + 2–3 photocopies). You can order online via [PSAHelpline.ph](https://psahelpline.ph) or visit the nearest PSA outlet.

2. **PSA CENOMAR (Certificate of No Marriage)** — This certifies you have no existing marriage on record. Must be recent (typically within 3–6 months). Also available online via PSAHelpline.ph.

3. **Valid Government-Issued IDs** — At least two (2) valid IDs per applicant (e.g., passport, driver's license, UMID, PhilID, voter's ID).

4. **Community Tax Certificate (Cedula)** — Obtain from the City Treasurer's Office or your barangay.

5. **Barangay Certificate/Certificate of Residency** — From the barangay where you reside, certifying you are a resident.

6. **Pre-Marriage Counseling Certificate** — Issued after attending the required seminars (more details per city below).

7. **Responsible Parenthood and Family Planning Seminar Certificate** — Required under R.A. 10354. Usually handled by the City Health Office or DSWD.

8. **Marriage License Application Form** — Filled out at the LCR office (both must be present).

### Additional Requirements for Special Cases

- **Widowed applicants:** PSA Death Certificate of the deceased spouse + CENOMAR
- **Annulled applicants:** Certified True Copy of Annulment Decision & Certificate of Finality + annotated PSA Marriage Certificate + Certificate of Registration from the LCR where the annulment was registered
- **Applicants aged 18–21:** Parental Consent (parents must personally appear with valid IDs)
- **Applicants aged 22–25:** Parental Advice (parents personally appear or submit notarized advice)

### For Foreign Nationals (Marrying a Filipino)

- Valid Passport (with stamped/printed date of arrival in the Philippines) — original + photocopies
- **Certificate of Legal Capacity to Contract Marriage (CLCCM)** — issued by their embassy or consulate in the Philippines

- NBI Clearance (if residing in the Philippines for 6+ months)

> **Tip for Americans:** The U.S. Embassy/Consular Agency in Cebu (located at Waterfront Hotel, Lahug) does not issue a CLCCM. Instead, they provide an **Affidavit in Lieu of Certificate of Legal Capacity** for $50. This is accepted by Metro Cebu LCRs.

## Pro Tips for a Smooth Marriage License Application

1. **Start early — at least 1–2 months before your target wedding date.** Between scheduling seminars, waiting for PSA documents, and the 10-day posting period, things add up fast.

2. **Order your PSA Birth Certificate and CENOMAR online first.** Go to [PSAHelpline.ph](https://psahelpline.ph) and order them before doing anything else. Delivery takes about 3–7 business days within Cebu.

3. **Bring extra photocopies of everything.** At least 3 photocopies per document. You'd rather have extras than make a last-minute trip to a photocopying shop.

4. **Keep all official receipts.** Attach them to the corresponding document. LCR staff will ask for them.

5. **Double-check your documents for consistency.** Your name, birthdate, and other details must match across your birth certificate, CENOMAR, IDs, and (if applicable) baptismal/confirmation certificates. Discrepancies will cause delays.

6. **Bring cash.** Most city halls only accept cash payments. No GCash or credit cards at the LCR.

7. **Both applicants must appear together** at every step that requires personal appearance (LCR filing, seminars). Don't assume one person can process everything alone.

8. **Ask questions.** LCR staff in Metro Cebu are generally helpful. If you're unsure about anything, ask before you leave the office.

9. **For church weddings, your marriage license is just the start.** You'll also need baptismal certificates, confirmation certificates, pre-Cana seminar, canonical interview, and more depending on your parish.

10. **Keep a folder or clear book** to organize all your documents safely. You'll be carrying these around for several weeks.

## After You Get Your Marriage License

Once your marriage license is in hand, here's what comes next:

- **For civil weddings:** Coordinate with the judge, mayor, or authorized solemnizing officer. Bring your marriage license, IDs, and at least two witnesses of legal age.

- **For church weddings:** Submit the marriage license to your parish along with the other church requirements. Coordinate the wedding date with the parish office well in advance.

- **After the wedding:** Your officiant must submit the signed Marriage Contract (Certificate of Marriage) to the LCR within 15 days. The LCR forwards it to the PSA for national registration. You can request your PSA Marriage Certificate about 2–3 months after the wedding.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I apply for a marriage license in a city where neither of us lives?**
No. At least one of the applicants must be a habitual resident of the city where you're filing.

**Can I use my marriage license from Cebu City to get married in Lapu-Lapu?**
Yes! Once issued, your marriage license is valid **anywhere in the Philippines** for 120 days.

**What if my PSA Birth Certificate has errors?**
You'll need to have it corrected first through the LCR (under R.A. 9048 for clerical errors) before you can use it for your marriage license application. This can take additional time, so check your documents early.

**Is there a way to skip the 10-day posting period?**
Generally, no. The 10-day posting period is mandated by the Family Code. The only exception is under **Article 34** — if you and your partner have lived together as husband and wife for at least 5 years with no legal impediment, you may execute an Affidavit of Cohabitation in lieu of a marriage license.

**How much does the entire process cost?**
Budget around **P1,000–P3,000 total per couple**, covering PSA documents (P155 each for birth certificate + P210 for CENOMAR via online), seminar fees, application fees, cedula, barangay certificates, and photocopies.

**Can foreigners get married in Metro Cebu?**
Yes, as long as they secure a Certificate of Legal Capacity to Contract Marriage (CLCCM) from their embassy and comply with all LCR requirements.
